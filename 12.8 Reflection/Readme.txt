Exercise

Write a program that creates instances of the following classes:
QSpinBox
QProcess
QTimer
and shows the user a list of properties (and values for those that can convert to a QString)
plus a list of all the method names.

My Notes:
This may be easier to do using a console app as there's a lot of text output.
